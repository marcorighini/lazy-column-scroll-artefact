# lazy-column-scroll-artefact

The issue is the following. With a background like 0xff020209 and items with background 0xff141416 there are noticeable artefacts while scrolling in the top and bottom edges, depending on the scrolling direction.
It doesn't happen if there's more contrast between background and the items.
